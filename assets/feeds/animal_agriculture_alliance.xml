            <description><![CDATA[<p>Animal agriculture advocacy comes in many different forms, each with the common goal of building trust between producers and the public, encouraging transparency, and supporting responsible, sustainable practices within the industry. Whether it’s a farmer sharing their daily life on social media, an industry expert speaking at an educational event, or a student participating in youth programs like 4-H and FFA, advocacy is happening all around us. You can find it in barns, classrooms, online platforms, community events, and even at family dinner tables. Each setting presents a valuable opportunity to tell agriculture’s story. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Amid the golden fields and early morning routines, a silent struggle is occurring in the agriculture community—mental health. While farmers and ranchers are known for their resilience and grit, the weight of isolation, financial pressures, unpredictable weather, and generational expectations can take a heavy toll. It’s time to break the silence and acknowledge that mental well-being is just as vital as physical health. I want to take a moment to shine a light on the unique challenges faced by those who feed the world—and why mental health awareness has become part of the conversation in rural America.  </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Summer is often characterized by a few common things: the smell of freshly cut grass, splashing in a pool, or eating meat off the grill. There’s also one undeniable factor about the summer: it can get hot. Not only do we have to endure the heat, but our animals do too.</p>
