  static const String rules = '''
    --- SECTION A: SUPPLY CHAIN & TECH RISKS (Critical Weight -9) ---
    1. Component Shortages: Semiconductors/Chips scarcity delaying machinery delivery.
    2. Rare Earth Supply: China export restrictions affecting EV batteries and electronics.
    3. Production Halts: Strikes at major machinery plants (e.g., Deere, CNH).
    4. Cyber Security: Ransomware attacks on precision ag data networks or grid infrastructure.
    5. Energy Costs: High diesel/electricity prices reducing ROI on heavy machinery.

    --- SECTION B: REGULATORY & CHEMICAL RISKS (High Weight -8) ---
    6. Chemical Bans: EU/EPA restrictions on Glyphosate, Dicamba, or Neonicotinoids.
    7. Right to Repair: Legislation forcing OEMs to open proprietary software, affecting margins.
    8. Emissions Standards: Tier 5 engine requirements increasing equipment cost.
    9. Drone Regulations: FAA/Transport Canada restrictions on BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) flights.
    10. Data Privacy: Government or farmer pushback on ownership of field data.

    --- SECTION C: FINANCIAL & ADOPTION BARRIERS (Medium Weight -7) ---
    11. High Interest Rates: CapEx crunch preventing farmers from financing new fleets.
    12. Farm Income Drop: Low commodity prices reducing budget for upgrades.
    13. Infrastructure Gaps: Lack of rural 5G/Broadband limiting connectivity for IoT devices.
    14. Skill Gap: Shortage of technicians to service complex autonomous units.

    --- SECTION D: EMERGING TRENDS (Positive/Neutral) ---
    15. Autonomy: Fully autonomous tractors and tillage (e.g., Deere 8R, CNH Raven).
    16. Precision Spraying: See & Spray AI technology reducing chemical use by 50-70%.
    17. Biologicals: Shift from synthetic inputs to bio-stimulants and RNA-based pesticides.
    18. Ag Drones: Swarm seeding, crop scouting, and spot-spraying adoption.
    19. Robotics: Fruit picking robots and automated weeding (laser/mechanical) replacing labor.
    20. Livestock Monitoring: Wearable sensors (smart tags) for bio-medical health tracking.
    21. Gene Editing: CRISPR crops improving drought resistance without GMO stigma.
    22. Electrification: EV tractors for vineyards/orchards (e.g., Monarch Tractor).
    23. Vertical Farming: Controlled Environment Ag (CEA) tech for urban food security.
